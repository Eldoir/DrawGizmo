# DrawGizmo

A simple plugin to display a gizmo on any GameObject, using a cube, a sphere or a custom sprite.

## Getting Started

For a quick import into an existing project, just get the [UnityPackage](DrawGizmoPackage.unitypackage).

The DrawGizmo folder is an empty project with only the plugin imported and some examples! :)

## Prerequisites

There are absolutely no prerequisites to this plugin.

Everything comes into a few files.
