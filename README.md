# DrawGizmo

A simple plugin to display a gizmo on any GameObject, using a cube, a sphere or a custom sprite.

Especially useful for spotting empty GameObjects in the Scene view.

## Getting Started

For a quick import into an existing project, just get the [UnityPackage](DrawGizmoPackage.unitypackage).

The DrawGizmo folder is an empty project with only the plugin imported and some examples! :)

## Notes

There isn't a "Radius" field for DrawGizmo when the selected Gizmo Type is "Sprite".
You can change the size of the sprite by clicking on the **Gizmos** button in the Scene view, and using the slider next to the **3D Icons** checkbox. More info at [Unity - Manual: Gizmos menu](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GizmosMenu.html)
